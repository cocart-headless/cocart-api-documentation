For more handling over CoCart for your store or a client, you will find that using the `wp-config.php` file is the best place to setup certain conditions.

## Uninstall

To prevent any data loss when uninstalling CoCart from the backend and to ensure only the site owner can perform this action. You need to enable the ability to remove it.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Allows the full un-installation of CoCart.
 */
define( 'COCART_REMOVE_ALL_DATA', true );
```

## White Labelling

If you are developing a headless store for a client and need to hide CoCart. Enabling white label mode comes in handy if that is something you would want.

Enabling this hides CoCart completely from the backend including the admin menu, plugin row links, plugin notices, WooCommerce inbox notices and WooCommerce System Status information.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Hides CoCart from the WordPress dashboard.
 */
define( 'COCART_WHITE_LABEL', true );
```
