        Usually it's your bank issuing the decline, for a number of different reasons like insufficient funds, they think the transaction is fraudulent or you typed the wrong CCV.

        We do not. Lifetime deals are really for products/services that don’t require much maintenance or any for that matter to keep working.

## Multisite Questions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How many site licenses do I need for a multisite?">
        To use one of our plugins on a WordPress multisite, you will need a license for each sub-site where you will be using it. For example:
        * If you want to use it on 5 sites in a multisite then you will need a license for 5 sites.
        * If your multisite contains 10 sites but you only want to use the plugin on 1 site, you will need a single site license.

        You should enter the license key on the plugin settings page for each site where you want to use the plugin.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Do I need to network activate the plugin?">
        Yes, the plugin should be network activated even if you are only using it on 1 site within the multisite. This is needed in order to update the plugin.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I upgrade my existing license?">
        Yes, you can upgrade your license. If you need more than 20 sites, please get in touch.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Support and Plugin Questions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What support do you offer?">
        We offer support for all our products through our [Discord community](https://cocartapi.com/community).

        Support is available to all users with a valid license key.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are updates free?">
        Plugin updates for the core plugin and any free add-ons will always get free updates. CoCart Plus and any premium add-on requires a valid license key to receive updates.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I update CoCart?">
        CoCart can be updated either via one-click update or manually. When an update becomes available, you will receive a notification on your **Plugins** page.

        To update CoCart, simply click on the "Update Now" link in the notification on the Plugins page.

        If you prefer to update manually, you can download the new version of the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository. You can then safely delete the plugin directory on your server, and upload the new version via FTP.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I uninstall?">
        We can’t imagine why you’d want to, but you most certainly can uninstall.

        You’ll need to deactivate CoCart first by clicking on the "Deactivate" link on the Plugins page, followed by the "Delete" link.

        This will remove all of the plugin’s files from the WordPress plugins directory.

        <Note>
            It does not deactivate your license and you will need to repeat the process if you have any CoCart add-ons installed as well.
        </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Is it safe to uninstall?">
        Uninstalling CoCart will not affect any of your store data such as products or orders should you decide to not use CoCart.

        Please note, however, your headless store will no longer have access to any of CoCart's API endpoints and all current cart sessions will no longer exist.

        If you are using CoCart specific functions to access data in your plugin files, these functions will no longer exist, and your website will no longer function as expected.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How well does it work with other plugins?">
        CoCart utilizes all WooCommerce functions and hooks so other plugins that rely on them are compatible.

        Some plugins expect certain behaviour when items are added to the cart so we do our best to cover those expectations in a guide should it be needed.

        There are over **50K plugins** available in the WordPress directory, WooCommerce’s marketplace and others out there in the WordPress abyss, some conflicts may arise.

        In the unusual circumstance that such an issue occurs, we will always do our utmost to try and resolve those conflicts through our friendly support.

        We do have a [list of WooCommerce extensions](/plugins/woocommerce-extensions.mdx) that have been tested and are known to work with CoCart.
    </Accordion>

## License Questions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What is a license key?">
        A license key, also known as an activation key, is a unique alphanumeric code used to authenticate and activate software.

        It serves as a form of digital rights management (DRM) to ensure that only legitimate users can access and use the software.

        It also enables us to control and monitor the number of installations and ensure that users comply with the terms of the software license agreement.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where can I find my license key?">
        After purchasing, you will receive a unique license key via email and your [Polar account](https://polar.sh/cocartheadless/portal/request) with your purchase.

    <Accordion title="What if I lose my license key?">
        If you lose your license key, you can retrieve it from your [Polar account](https://polar.sh/cocartheadless/portal/request) or contact support for assistance.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I move my license key to another domain?">
        If you only purchased a license for one site, you first need to deactivate the license key from the CoCart updates page on the domain it was activated on.

        Then simply activate the license key on the domain you want.

        <Note>
            If you originally activated the license key on a staging/local site then it won't count as a site activation and you can simply go ahead and activate the license key on the production site.
        </Note>

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Will Local & staging installations count against my license limit?">

## Troubleshoot Questions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="I can't seem to connect to the update server?">
        In some hosting environments, communication may not be possible between your server and the WordPress update server.

        If this happens to you, please note any error messages you find, and [contact support](mailto:support@cocartapi.com).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I added several products but only 1 item returns in cart. Why?">
        This is possibly because you did not set the cart key as a global parameter on other Cart API requests. So all your seeing is the last item added to the cart.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I'm having a cache issue with the cart API. What can I do?">
        If you are using a caching plugin, you will need to exclude the cart API from being cached. The best way to do this is to exclude the entire `/cocart/v2/cart` endpoint from being cached. This will ensure that all cart-related requests are not cached.

        Currently CoCart already excludes from being cached in the following cache plugins:
        * [LiteSpeed](https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/)
        * [WP REST Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-cache/)
        * [WP REST API Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-cache/)
        * [WP Rocket](https://wp-rocket.me/)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="As administrator can I create and update a customers cart?">
        Unfortunately, no. This is because when you authenticate as the admin, you are logged in not the customer. Even if you specified the customers user ID as the cart key. It will not take affect.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How can I view debug logs recorded?">
        If you have **WP_DEBUG** set to `true` in your [wp-config.php](#wp-config-php) file then you should be able to view all the logs recorded by CoCart under **WooCommerce -> System Status -> Logs** in your WordPress dashboard.

        URL Example: `https://example-store.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-status&tab=logs`

        You can also [change how the logs are presented](#filters-api-access-cocart-logging).
