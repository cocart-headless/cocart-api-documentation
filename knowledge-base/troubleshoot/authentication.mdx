    <Accordion title="Issue with authenticating in general?">
        You may need to add this to your **.htaccess** file in the parent folder where your WordPress installation is. Once added, restart the server and authentication should work.

        ```apache
        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
        RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
        </IfModule>
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Basic authentication not working?">
        Basic authentication is recommended to be used on secure sites that have SSL enabled, so if you attempting to authenticate CoCart without it being secured. Then it will simply fail.

        <Info>
            If you are testing on a local or development environment, CoCart will allow you to authenticate via the basic method.
        </Info>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How can I authenticate as a customer?">
        CoCart supports all standard and additional support for identifying ways to login.

        * Username + Password
        * Email + Password
        * Billing Phone Number + Password

        How you choose to allow your customers to login is up to you.

        <Note>
            Should the customer forget the username they created or what was assigned when registering as a customer, using their email address instead is good alternative.
        </Note>

        <RequestExample>
        ```bash cURL
            curl --request POST \
                --url https://localhost/wp-json/cocart/v2/login \
                --header "Authorization: Basic " + btoa('username:password')
                --header "Content-Type: application/json"
        ```
        </RequestExample>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Not possible to use authentication headers, alternative?">
        If it is not be possible to authenticate the right way using the headers, you can authenticate the user via URL.

        ```bash
        wp-json/cocart/v2/login?username=sebastien@domain.com&password=password
        ```
