## Secure Storage

<Warning>
    **localStorage** is vulnerable to XSS attacks and should not be used for storing sensitive tokens in production applications.
</Warning>

Here are recommended approaches for token storage, in order of security:

1. **HttpOnly Cookies** (Most Secure)
    - Protected from XSS attacks
    - Automatic CSRF protection when configured properly
    - Handled automatically by browsers

2. **Web Workers + IndexedDB**
    - Isolated from main thread
    - Protected from XSS
    - More complex implementation

3. **In-Memory Storage**
    - Cleared on page refresh
    - Protected from XSS
    - Requires state management solution

## Server-Side Configuration

Your server should set cookies with secure options:

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript JavaScript
    // Example server-side cookie configuration (Express.js)
    res.cookie('jwt_token', token, {
        httpOnly: true,     // Prevents JavaScript access
        secure: true,       // Requires HTTPS
        sameSite: 'strict', // CSRF protection
        maxAge: 3600000,    // 1 hour
        path: '/'           // Cookie path
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTPS** for token transmission
2. **Set appropriate cookie flags:**
    - HttpOnly
    - Secure
    - SameSite=Strict
3. **Implement CSRF protection**
4. **Use short token expiration times**
5. **Rotate refresh tokens**
