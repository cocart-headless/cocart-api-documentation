<Note>
    Auto Address is only available with [CoCart Plus](https://cocartapi.com/pricing/).
</Note>

<Info>
    Provider selection is handled automatically server-side based on configuration and country. Developers configure the provider(s) during setup, and the API automatically selects the appropriate provider. The `provider` field in responses is informational only - customers use it to pass back to the details endpoint.

## Best Practices

1. **Debounce input** - Wait 300-500ms after user stops typing before searching
2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide fallback to manual entry
3. **Cache results** - Consider caching suggestions client-side
4. **Validate addresses** - Always validate the final address before checkout
5. **Store provider ID** - Save the provider ID from search results to use in the details request

## Performance Considerations

- Minimum query length enforced (3 characters) to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Provider is automatically selected server-side based on country and configuration
- Results are not cached server-side to ensure fresh data
- Consider implementing client-side caching and debouncing
