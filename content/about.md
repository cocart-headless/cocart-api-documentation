# About CoCart

## Our Story

What started as a simple solution to a common problem has grown into something much bigger. CoCart was born from the real-world challenges of integrating WooCommerce with modern headless architectures. As developers ourselves, we understood the frustration of working with traditional REST APIs that weren't built for the headless commerce era.
