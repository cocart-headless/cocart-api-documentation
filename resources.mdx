### Disable REST API

<Note>
    Why recommend this? Because you may not want all REST API's registered on your WordPress site exposed or simply don't use them.

The most comprehensive plugin for controlling access to the WordPress REST API. Useful to disable routes you are not using.

<Info>
    We developed our own security plugin designed specifically for the REST API to provide a firewall from bad requests and protection for data exposed without authentication such as the index listing the routes available.

    **List of Features**
    * Hides all sensitive details from the `wp-json` index.
    * Deny access to any API route if the `user-agent` is not trust worthy or a bot.
    * Block use of any API route in an iFrame.
    * Rate limiting for any route.
    * Anonymous user data returned if accessed without authentication.
    * CORs support.
    * Permissions callback override for any route and method.
