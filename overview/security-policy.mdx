## Supported Versions

The CoCart Headless Security Team believes in Responsible Disclosure by alerting the security team immediately and privately of any potential vulnerabilities. If a critical vulnerability is found in any of the current versions of a CoCart plugin, we may opt to backport any patches to previous versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**For responsible disclosure of security issues, please submit your report based on instructions found on [cocartapi.com/security-policy/](https://cocartapi.com/security-policy/).**

Our most critical targets are:

* CoCart Core [repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart)
* CoCart Plus
* CoCart JWT Authentication [repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cocart-headless/cocart-jwt-authentication)
* cocartapi.com -- the primary marketplace and marketing site.

## Guidelines

We're committed to working with security researchers to resolve the vulnerabilities they discover. You can help us by following these guidelines:

*   Pen-testing Production:
    *   Please **setup a local environment** instead whenever possible. Most of our code is open source (see above).
    *   If that's not possible, **limit any data access/modification** to the bare minimum necessary to reproduce a PoC.
    *   **Don't automate form submissions!** That's very annoying for us, because it adds extra work for the volunteers who manage those systems, and reduces the signal/noise ratio in our communication channels.
*   Be Patient - Give us a reasonable time to correct the issue before you disclose the vulnerability.
