CoCart is purpose-built for developers and designers to transform a WooCommerce store into a powerful, decoupled eCommerce store — and liberates your store from WordPress's traditional constraints with a robust REST API.

Build a modern and scalable storefront with confidence independent of WordPress using frameworks like **Astro**, **React**, **Vue**, or **Next.js**, gaining complete control over your customers experience no matter what your store sells.

Our intuitive API handles management, calculations, and processing, delivering optimal performance across any configuration.
