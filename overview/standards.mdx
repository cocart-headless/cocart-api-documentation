CoCart API provides public Rest API endpoints for the development of customer-facing cart, ~~checkout~~, and product functionality. It follows many of the patterns used in the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/).

Example of a valid API request using cURL:

```http
curl "https://example-store.com/wp-json/cocart/v2/products"
```

Possible uses of the CoCart API include:

- Obtaining a list of products to display that can be searched or filtered
- Adding products to the cart and returning an updated cart object for display
- Obtaining shipping rates for a cart
- Collecting a customers's addresses

## Versioning

CoCart API will be safely versioned using root path versioning, in the format `/v{major}`. For example, `/cocart/v2/cart`.

The current supported WordPress REST API integration for CoCart is version `v2`.

## CoCart API Namespace

Resources in the CoCart API are all found within the `cocart/v2` namespace, and since this API extends the WordPress API, accessing it requires the `/wp-json/` base.

Examples:

```
GET /wp-json/cocart/v2/products
GET /wp-json/cocart/v2/cart
```

The API uses JSON to serialize data. You don’t need to specify .json at the end of an API URL.

<Tip>
    If you want to change the CoCart API Namespace, we have an add-on in the works that will do just that. Please show interest by contacting support to be on waitlist.

## Versioning Strategy

The main principles of the strategy are:

1. All breaking changes will be bundled into a new version
2. Deprecations for existing versions whenever a new version is announced is 6 months
3. In order to provide quicker adoption of new changes, they will be released on on ongoing basis
5. All API responses will contain the version of CoCart core via the returned header `CoCart-Version` if you have `WP_DEBUG` enabled which will be set to the current version of the plugin you are using.

Should there be any fundamental requirement changes that require an API breaking change, we will notify via a blog post.

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are any changes that require developer resources to maintain existing functionality. This includes resources used for investigation into the changes that need to be made, determination of features/endpoints being deprecated and final implementation of all these changes. A list of breaking changes are things like:

* Removing a param from the API request/response
* Modifying the name for any params or endpoints
* Adding/changing optional or required params (e.g., making a customers name a required field in the request)

We won’t make breaking changes to existing API endpoints for API versions lower than `v2`. If breaking changes are necessary that changes the data in the response, we’ll release a new major version. We may deprecate APIs that have been replaced by a newer version.

When doing so, we will expect developers to manage a transition to the new resources within the deprecation timeline of old ones.

Changes we do not consider to be breaking:

- Adding new endpoints
- Adding optional query parameters to API endpoints
- Adding new properties to existing API responses
- Reordering properties in existing API responses

It is important that clients are built to be robust to these changes.

**Deprecation**: Deprecated versions will be unsupported and it is recommended that developers cease to use these APIs.

**Sunset**: Once an API is sunset, the corresponding set of endpoints will no longer be accessible via the API.

## Requirements and limitations

- This is an unauthenticated API. It does not require API keys or authentication tokens for access.
- All API responses return JSON-formatted data.
- Data returned from the API is reflective of the current user (customer). Sessions are token based.
- CoCart API cannot be used to look up other customers and orders by ID; only data belonging to the current user.
- Likewise, CoCart API cannot be used to write store data e.g. settings. For more extensive access, use the authenticated [WooCommerce REST API](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#introduction).
- Endpoints that do allow writes, for example, updating the current customer address, require a cart key or user ID by authentication.
- CoCart API is render-target agnostic and should not make assumptions about where content will be displayed. For example, returning HTML would be discouraged unless the data type itself is HTML.

## Pagination

If collections contain many results, they may be paginated. When listing resources you can pass the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| page      | Current page of the collection. Defaults to 1.                                     |
| per_page  | Maximum number of items to be returned in result set. Defaults to 10. Maximum 100. |

<Tip>
    Large queries can hurt site performance, so `per_page` is capped at **100 records**. If you wish to retrieve more than 100 records, for example to build a client-side list of all available categories, you may make multiple API requests and combine the results within your application.
</Tip>

In the example below, we list 20 products per page and return page 2.

```http
curl "https://example-store.com/wp-json/cocart/v2/products?page=2&per_page=20"
```

Additional pagination headers are also sent back to help determine how much more data is available.

| Header          | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-WP-Total      | The total number of items in the collection.                        |
| X-WP-TotalPages | The total number of pages in the collection.                        |
| Link            | Contains links to other pages; next, prev, and up where applicable. |

## Status Codes

The following table gives an overview of how the API functions generally behave.

| Request type | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`        | Access one or more resources and return `200 OK` and the result as JSON.                                    |
| `POST`       | Return `201 Created` if the resource is successfully created and return the newly created resource as JSON. |
| `PUT`        | Return `200 OK` if the resource is modified successfully. The modified result is returned as JSON.          |
| `DELETE`     | Returns `204 No Content` if the resource was deleted successfully.                                          |

The following table shows the possible return codes for API requests.

| Status Code                 | Description                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`                    | The request was successful, the resource(s) itself is returned as JSON. |
| `201 Created`               | The POST request was successful and the resource is returned as JSON.   |
| `204 No Content`            | The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. |
| `400 Bad Request`           | A required attribute of the API request is missing.                     |
| `401 Unauthorized`          | Authentication or permission error, e.g. incorrect login.               |
| `403 Forbidden`             | Not allowed to process this action or have permission.                  |
| `404 Not Found`             | A resource could not be accessed, for example it doesn't exist.         |
| `405 Method Not Allowed`    | A request method is not supported for the requested resource.           |
| `406 Not Acceptable`        | Indicates that the server could not produce a response.                 |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | While handling the request something went wrong server-side.            |

## Route Handling

Typically, routes handle the following types of requests:

- `GET` requests to read product, cart, or checkout data.
- `POST` and `PUT` requests to update cart and checkout data.
- `DELETE` requests to remove cart data.
- `OPTIONS` requests to retrieve the JSON schema for the current route.

Ideally, your server should be configured to accept these types of API requests (`POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`), but if not you can use the [`_method`](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/global-parameters/#_method-or-x-http-method-override-header) property.

## Dates

Datetime fields in the APIs conform to the **[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)** date and time format in UTC. For example: `2025-03-22T11:56:48.520641Z`.

## Country Codes

Countries are identified in the APIs using **[ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)** codes. For example: `GB` and `US`.

## Currency

Currency are identified in the APIs using **[ISO-4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)** codes. This is a three-letter string like `USD` or `EUR`. The value of a currency is represented by your WooCommerce store settings on the **General** tab.

Most currencies have a “precision” of two (like USD: $1.23).

* `AED`, `VEF`, `PKR`, `IDR`, `HKD`, `QAR`, `PHP`, `NZD`, `INR`, `EUR`, `ARS`, `THB`, `MXN`, `EGP`, `DZD`, `SAR`, `LBP`, `COP`, `TRY`, `SGD`, `MAD`, `AUD`, `USD`, `MYR`, `CAD`, `BRL`, `GBP`.

The following currencies don’t use a decimal:

* `VND`, `KRW`, `CLP`, `JPY`

And these use three decimal places:

* `KWD`, `IQD`, `BHD`, `TND`

<Tip>
    It is important that you set the currency correctly for the API to return price values correctly.
