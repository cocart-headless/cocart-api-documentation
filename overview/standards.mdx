CoCart API provides public Rest API endpoints for the development of customer-facing cart, ~~checkout~~, and product functionality. It follows many of the patterns used in the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/).

Example of a valid API request using cURL:

```http
curl "https://example-store.com/wp-json/cocart/v2/products"
```

Possible uses of the CoCart API include:

- Obtaining a list of products to display that can be searched or filtered
- Adding products to the cart and returning an updated cart object for display
- Obtaining shipping rates for a cart
- Collecting a customers's addresses

## Versioning

CoCart API will be safely versioned using root path versioning, in the format `/v{major}`. For example, `/cocart/v2/cart`.

The current supported WordPress REST API integration for CoCart is version `v2`.

## CoCart API Namespace

Resources in the CoCart API are all found within the `cocart/v2` namespace, and since this API extends the WordPress API, accessing it requires the `/wp-json/` base.

Examples:

```
GET /wp-json/cocart/v2/products
GET /wp-json/cocart/v2/cart
```

The API uses JSON to serialize data. You don’t need to specify .json at the end of an API URL.

<Tip>
    If you want to change the CoCart API Namespace, we have an add-on in the works that will do just that. Please show interest by contacting support to be on waitlist.
</Tip>

## Compatibility

We won’t make breaking changes to existing API endpoints for API versions lower than `v2`. If breaking changes are necessary, we’ll release a new major version. We may deprecate APIs that have been replaced by a newer version.

When doing so, we will expect developers to manage a transition to the new resources within the deprecation timeline of old ones.

We will make the following sort of changes we do not consider to be breaking:

- Adding new endpoints
- Adding optional query parameters to API endpoints
- Adding new properties to existing API responses
- Reordering properties in existing API responses

It is important that clients are built to be robust to these changes.

## Requirements and limitations

- This is an unauthenticated API. It does not require API keys or authentication tokens for access.
- All API responses return JSON-formatted data.
- Data returned from the API is reflective of the current user (customer). Sessions are token based.
- CoCart API cannot be used to look up other customers and orders by ID; only data belonging to the current user.
- Likewise, CoCart API cannot be used to write store data e.g. settings. For more extensive access, use the authenticated [WooCommerce REST API](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#introduction).
- Endpoints that do allow writes, for example, updating the current customer address, require a cart key or user ID by authentication.
- CoCart API is render-target agnostic and should not make assumptions about where content will be displayed. For example, returning HTML would be discouraged unless the data type itself is HTML.

## Pagination

If collections contain many results, they may be paginated. When listing resources you can pass the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| page      | Current page of the collection. Defaults to 1.                                     |
| per_page  | Maximum number of items to be returned in result set. Defaults to 10. Maximum 100. |

<Tip>
    Large queries can hurt site performance, so `per_page` is capped at **100 records**. If you wish to retrieve more than 100 records, for example to build a client-side list of all available categories, you may make multiple API requests and combine the results within your application.
</Tip>

In the example below, we list 20 products per page and return page 2.

```http
curl "https://example-store.com/wp-json/cocart/v2/products?page=2&per_page=20"
```

Additional pagination headers are also sent back to help determine how much more data is available.

| Header          | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-WP-Total      | The total number of items in the collection.                        |
| X-WP-TotalPages | The total number of pages in the collection.                        |
| Link            | Contains links to other pages; next, prev, and up where applicable. |

## Status Codes

The following table gives an overview of how the API functions generally behave.

| Request type | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`        | Access one or more resources and return `200 OK` and the result as JSON.                                    |
| `POST`       | Return `201 Created` if the resource is successfully created and return the newly created resource as JSON. |
| `PUT`        | Return `200 OK` if the resource is modified successfully. The modified result is returned as JSON.          |
| `DELETE`     | Returns `204 No Content` if the resource was deleted successfully.                                          |

The following table shows the possible return codes for API requests.

| Status Code                 | Description                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`                    | The request was successful, the resource(s) itself is returned as JSON. |
| `201 Created`               | The POST request was successful and the resource is returned as JSON.   |
| `204 No Content`            | The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. |
| `400 Bad Request`           | A required attribute of the API request is missing.                     |
| `401 Unauthorized`          | Authentication or permission error, e.g. incorrect login.               |
| `403 Forbidden`             | Not allowed to process this action or have permission.                  |
| `404 Not Found`             | A resource could not be accessed, for example it doesn't exist.         |
| `405 Method Not Allowed`    | A request method is not supported for the requested resource.           |
| `406 Not Acceptable`        | Indicates that the server could not produce a response.                 |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | While handling the request something went wrong server-side.            |

## Route Handling

Typically, routes handle the following types of requests:

- `GET` requests to read product, cart, or checkout data.
- `POST` and `PUT` requests to update cart and checkout data.
- `DELETE` requests to remove cart data.
- `OPTIONS` requests to retrieve the JSON schema for the current route.

Ideally, your server should be configured to accept these types of API requests (`POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`), but if not you can use the [`_method`](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/global-parameters/#_method-or-x-http-method-override-header) property.

## Dates

Datetime fields in the APIs conform to the **[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)** date and time format in UTC. For example: `2025-03-22T11:56:48.520641Z`.

## Country Codes

Countries are identified in the APIs via **[ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)** codes. For example: `GB` and `US`.
