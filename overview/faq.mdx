<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How do I setup CoCart?">
        Please see the getting started section for [CoCart setup](/getting-started/core/setup). Being based on the WordPress REST-API, it’s extremely easy to get started.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is a REST API?">
        REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that communicate over HTTP, similar to how web browsers interact with servers. It provides a standardized way for applications to exchange data and perform operations.

        Recommend reading the [REST API handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) for more information.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is the source of truth?">
        CoCart reads the WooCommerce data and exposes it safely in the REST API. This allows the use of most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What are the benefits of a headless store?">
        A headless store allows you to separate the front-end and back-end of your eCommerce application. This means you can use any technology stack for the front-end while still leveraging WooCommerce's powerful capabilities.

        Benefits include:
        - Flexibility in choosing front-end technologies.
        - Improved performance and user experience.
        - Easier integration with third-party services.
        - Enhanced scalability and maintainability.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I use the same domain for WordPress and the headless store?">
        While it is possible to use the same domain for both WordPress and the headless store. It is recommended to use a subdomain or a different domain for the headless store to avoid conflicts and ensure better performance.

        We have a [WordPress setup guide](/getting-started/wordpress-setup) that provides our recommendations for setting up a headless store with CoCart.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Does CoCart work for multi-site network?">
        Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it on the sites you want to use CoCart. The base URL to access the REST API will be based on your network configuration type.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are there any limitations?">
        CoCart is designed to be completely open to customization via **filters** and **action hooks**.

        CoCart does it's best to work out of the box with [WooCommerce extensions](/plugins/woocommerce-extensions) but we know that is not going to be always the case.

        If there is a compatibility issue with a plugin that you would like to work with CoCart. We would be happy to hear about it.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why does CoCart use a custom session handler and table in the database?">
        If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler?

        A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

        - The default session handler only supports cookies.
        - The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
        - The default session handler **does not support guest customers without cookies**.
        - The default session handler **does not store additional session data to help you**.
        - The default session handler **does not allow support for POS capability** (coming soon).
        - More consistent with modern web.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What WooCommerce extensions work with CoCart?">
        Take a look at our [tested and verified list](/plugins/woocommerce-extensions) for extensions that work with CoCart.

        We also have a list of [incompatible plugins](/plugins/incompatible) that don't work with CoCart.

        With over 50,000 plugins available in the WordPress directory, WooCommerce’s marketplace and others out there in the WordPress abyss, some conflicts may arise.

        In the unusual circumstance that such an issue occurs, we will always do our utmost to try and resolve those conflicts through our friendly support.
