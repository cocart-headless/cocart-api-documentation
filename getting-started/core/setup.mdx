### Alternative Source: GitHub

<Info>Versions of CoCart core below v5 will not have two versions, only a single zip file and will be labelled e.g. `cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce-v4.3.16.zip`</Info>

Every release of CoCart core since v5 has two versions of the plugin compiled added as a release asset either as a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` format.

###### Examples

* e.g. Regular zip - `cocart-core-v5.0.zip`
* e.g. [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/git-updater) supported zip - `cocart-core-github-v5.0.zip`

On the [releases page](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/releases), look under the “assets” section of the release you would like to install and download the compiled format that works best for you.

Once you have downloaded the plugin, follow the installation instructions.
