> Dev Note: Needs to be completed with some additional updates for new license system.

Once CoCart is installed you should see a new menu item named **CoCart** in your WordPress dashboard, plus the following notification that prompts you to activate your license for CoCart:

<Card title="Activation Notification" img="/images/card-with-image.png">
    This notification will ask you to enter your license key.
</Card>

Go to **CoCart > Updates** or click the **Activate License** link. This should bring up the license activation screen:

<Card title="Updates Screen" img="/images/card-with-image.png">
    Here you enter your license key.
</Card>

Copy your CoCart license key provided and paste it into the license field. Click **Save Changes**.

Your license should now be active:

<Card title="Updates Screen" img="/images/card-with-image.png">
    Confirmation that you have activated your license.
</Card>

Thatâ€™s it! You will now automatically receive updates for CoCart when they become available.
