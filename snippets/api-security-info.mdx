<Info>
    We developed our own security plugin designed specifically for the REST API to provide a firewall from bad requests and protection for data exposed without authentication.

    **List of Features**
    * Hides all sensitive details from the `wp-json` index.
    * Deny access to any API route if the `user-agent` is not trust worthy or a bot.
    * Block use of any API route in an iFrame.
    * Rate limiting for any route.
    * Anonymous user data returned if accessed without authentication.
    * CORS support.
