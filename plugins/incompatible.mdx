Most plugins that extend the frontend of WooCommerce should work out the box. However, those extensions that add or alter methods of applying data may not be 100% supported with CoCart.

These plugins in particular are not compatible with CoCart. If installed, they will cause issues with getting a valid response when using the REST API.

Next to each listed plugin is the reason for incompatibility.
