### WooCommerce Name Your Price
While CoCart does have this feature built in, [Name Your Price](https://woocommerce.com/products/name-your-price/) allows customers to name their own price for products.

### WooCommerce Smart Coupons
[Smart Coupons](https://woocommerce.com/products/smart-coupons/) allows you to create and manage coupons in your store.

### WooCommerce Mix and Match
[Mix and Match Products](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/) allows customers to create their own product bundles.

### WooCommerce Subscriptions 
[WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) enables recurring payments and subscription products in your store.

### WooCommerce Coupon Restrictions
[Coupon Restrictions](https://woocommerce.com/products/coupon-restrictions/) allows you to restrict coupons to specific products, categories, and more.

### WooCommerce Advanced Shipping Packages
[Advanced Shipping Packages](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-advanced-shipping-packages/) allows you to create and manage shipping packages in your store.

### WooCommerce Free Gift Coupons
[Free Gift Coupons](https://woocommerce.com/products/free-gift-coupons/) allows you to offer free gift coupons to customers.

### Table Rate Shipping Method for WooCommerce by Flexible Shipping
[Table Rate Shipping Method](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-shipping/) allows you to create and manage table rate shipping methods in your store.

### TaxJar â€“ Sales Tax Automation for WooCommerce
WooCommerce Automation blocks any tax calculations when using CoCart so we support [TaxJar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) instead to calculate sales tax for your store.

### WooCommerce Follow Up Emails
[Follow Up Emails](https://woocommerce.com/products/follow-up-emails/) allows you to send follow up emails to customers.
