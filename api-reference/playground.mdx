Create reproducible WooCommerce testing environment with the core of CoCart to test out the REST API right away. It generates a blueprint that:

- Configures pretty permalinks
- Installs WooCommerce
- Sets up basic store information
- Skips the onboarding wizard
- Configures basic WooCommerce settings
- Imports sample products
- Installs CoCart, JWT Authentication and CORS support
- Installs Safe SVG and Leira Letter Avatar plugins
- Installs the Storefront theme

The rest is up to you to play around with.

    Take the red pill and see how far the rabbit hole goes.
</Card>

## How it works:

- A fresh new WordPress site is created for you.
- You’ll be taken straight to the WordPress admin.
- Use the provided information to help you test the API.

## What to expect from Playground:

- Playground is valid for 30 days. After that the site expires and all data will be erased and can no longer be accessed.
- Test CoCart on a clean WordPress environment.
- Don’t worry about issues with CORS. It’s already setup.
- Try all our core features. No strings attached. Search, filter and return product data you need. Add products to cart either as a guest or a registered customer.
- Push CoCart to its limits. Don’t worry about breaking anything, it’s just a demo site.

## Can I install, import content or change WordPress to a Network Site?

Yes to all. You are the administrator of the playground.
