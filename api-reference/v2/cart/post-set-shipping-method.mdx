    title="How do I find my shipping rate ID/package ID?"
>
    If the cart response has not provided any shipping packages, your store must have requested the customer provides a shipping address before shipping rates can be calculated. This is the default behavior of WooCommerce.

    Once the shipping address has been provided, the cart response will include the `packages` object under **shipping**. This object contains an array of shipping packages each containing it's own set of `rates`.

    Each rate has a `key` and `instance_id`. The `key` is the shipping rate ID, and the `instance_id` is the package ID. You can use these values to set the shipping method for the cart.
