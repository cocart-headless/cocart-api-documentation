<Warning>
    This endpoint is currently shown as a preview of what's currently in development and is subject to change.
</Warning>

<Info>
    Provider selection is handled automatically server-side based on configuration and country. The API automatically selects the appropriate provider, but you can set the `provider` field when passed back to the details endpoint.
</Info>

## Country Detection Logic

When no country is explicitly provided, the API uses this fallback order:

1. Explicitly provided `country` parameter
2. Customer's existing billing/shipping address (for logged-in users)
3. Cart session country (if previously set)
4. Store's default base country
5. 'US' as ultimate fallback
