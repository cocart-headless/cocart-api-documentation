    <Accordion title="How do I create a batch request?">
        Standard WordPress batch requests are handled via `https://your-store.com/wp-json/batch/v1` endpoint.

        For example adding multiple products to the cart request looks like:
        ```json
        {
            "requests": [
                {
                    "method": "POST",
                    "path": "/cocart/v2/cart/add-item",
                    "body": {
                        "id": "35",
                        "quantity": "2"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "method": "POST",
                    "path": "/cocart/v2/cart/add-item",
                    "body": {
                        "id": "36",
                        "quantity": "5"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
