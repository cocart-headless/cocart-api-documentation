The [Name Your Price](https://woocommerce.com/products/name-your-price/) plugin extension lets you be flexible in what price you are willing to accept for selected products. You can use this plugin to accept donations or to take a new approach to selling products. You can suggest a price to your customers and optionally enforce a minimum acceptable price, or leave it entirely in the hands of the customer.

<Info>
    Name Your Price supports CoCart since <Tooltip tip="This is the version of the plugin">v3.1.0</Tooltip>
