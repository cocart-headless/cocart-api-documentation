## Contributing Code

If you wish to contribute code to CoCart, please read the information in the sections below. Then [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the CoCart repository, commit your changes, and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### License

CoCart Core is licensed under the GPLv3+, and all contributions to the project will be released under the same license. You maintain copyright over any contribution you make, and by submitting a pull request, you are agreeing to release that contribution under the GPLv3+ license.

### Getting Help

If you have questions about the process to contribute code or want to discuss details of your contribution, you can ask in the #support channel in the [CoCart community Discord](https://cocartapi.com/community/?ref=mintlify) server.

## Getting Started with Development

### Prerequisites

Before you begin contributing code:

1. [Setup LocalWP](https://localwp.com/releases/) and create a new WordPress site
2. Install WooCommerce and configure it with:
   - Dummy products (WooCommerce provides sample data)
   - Shipping methods
   - Tax settings
3. Install CoCart and start experimenting with the API

## Coding Guidelines and Development

<Tip>
    1. Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)
    2. Ensure you use **LF** line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
</Tip>

### Creating Branches

Branch names should go by the following structure (anything in `{}` brackets is a placeholder). **short-slug** should be replaced with a short name that best describes the changes, do ask for confirmation if needed.

- `refactor/{short-slug}` for refactors.
- `test/{short-slug}` for changes that are only test updates or additions.
- `fix/{short-slug}` for changes that fix a bug. Provide the issue number the fix is for and include that in the branch name.
- `add/{short-slug}` for changes that are adding a new feature.

### Commits

1. Make sure each commit addresses an atomic unit of work that independently works.
2. Make sure the commit message has a subject line which includes a brief description of the change and (if needed), why it was necessary. Write the subject in the imperative, start with a verb, and do not end with a period. The subject line should be **no longer than 50 characters**.
3. There must be an empty line between the subject line and the rest of the commit message (if any). The commit body should be **no longer than 72 characters**.
4. The commit message should explain what caused the problem and what its consequences are (if helpful for understanding the changes).
5. The commit message should explain how the changes achieve the goal, but only if it isn't obvious.

See [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.

<Info>
    Please avoid modifying the changelog directly or updating the .pot files. These will be updated by the CoCart team.

## Translating CoCart

It is recommended to translate CoCart via the [translate.cocartapi.com](https://translate.cocartapi.com/?ref=mintlify). You can join and help by translating there.

If any of the CoCart plugins are already **100% translated** for your language, join anyway! The language files are regularly updated with new strings that need translation and will likely be added soon.

## String localization guidelines

1. Use the plugins textdomain in all strings.
2. When using dynamic strings in `printf/sprintf`, if you are replacing more than 1 string, use numbered args. e.g. `Test %s string %s.` would be `Test %1$s string %2$s.`
3. Use sentence case. e.g. `Some Thing` should be `Some thing`.
4. Avoid HTML. If needed, insert the HTML using `sprintf`.
