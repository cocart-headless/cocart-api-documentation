Opening issues is a crucial step in open-source, as issues keep projects stable and help maintainers understand the needs of the community.

To help us maintain a stable project, please observe the following guidelines and general rules:

## Open issues for bugs only

We ask that **issues are only opened for bugs**, and not for questions. Questions should be asked in [Discussions](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/discussions) or on [Discord](https://cocartapi.com/community/?ref=mintlify).

While you may open a request for a feature. It would be best to ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/discussions) first to see if such a feature is possible.

## Include a proper reproduction

To ensure your issue can be addressed, please **include a proper reproduction**.

Please avoid:

* Setting the link to the reproduction pointing to our repository
* Providing a code snippet that does not sufficiently reproduce the issue

Failing to include a proper reproduction may require extra back-and-forth between you and us, slow the process of fixing the issue for you and others, and make it harder to check if the issue has been fixed on a new release.

## Test the latest version before opening an issue

Before opening an issue regarding a bug, please test with the latest stable version.

If the bug is fixed, you can still open an issue, and we will tag it with Fixed under the trunk branch so others will know it has been fixed.

If you do find that the bug was introduced in a specific version, and an older version didnâ€™t have the issue then you should mention that this is a regression and in what versions it was introduced.

## Conclusion

Now that you are ready, click below to open an issue! Thank you so much for contributing.
