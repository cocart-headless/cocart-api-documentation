<Update label="August 15, 2024" description="v1.5.4">

## Admin Notice & Totals Calculation Fix

Fixed an issue with admin notice removal in the WordPress dashboard and ensured cart totals are properly calculated before handling any data operations.

These fixes improve stability and prevent edge cases where cart data might be processed before totals are ready.

</Update>

## Cloudflare Support & Staging Detection

We've enhanced the rate limiter to properly detect Cloudflare's IP header, ensuring accurate rate limiting for sites behind Cloudflare's proxy.

InstaWP domains are now automatically recognized as staging sites, making it easier to test CoCart Plus without license restrictions.

Customer phone numbers and postcodes are now sanitized and formatted when validated, ensuring consistent data quality.

## Batch Requests & Shipping Details

This release introduces powerful new capabilities for handling multiple cart operations efficiently.

**Batch Endpoint** - Send multiple cart requests in a single API call and receive a unified cart response. This dramatically reduces API calls and improves performance for complex cart operations. (API v2 only)

We've also improved session initialization to fail gracefully when sessions aren't available, preventing errors in edge cases.

The rate limiter is fully configurable and includes detailed documentation to help you set appropriate limits for your store's needs. Check out our [Rate Limiting Guide](https://cocart.dev/guide/rate-limiting-guide/) for implementation details and testing strategies.

We've also fixed the coupon endpoint REST base to ensure compatibility with CoCart v4.0 and adjusted error status codes to better reflect response types.
