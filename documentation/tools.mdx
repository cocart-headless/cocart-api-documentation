## Local Environments

When preparing the WordPress side of your headless store locally, using either one of these desktop applications will help you to create new WordPress sites on your computer with the click of a few buttons.

They takes care of configuring _PHP_, _MySQL_ and basic configuration of WordPress to connect to the database. Some may provides one-click support for enabling _XDebug_, allow access to your WordPress site using _WP-CLI_, and more. All you need out of the box.

Quickly spin up a local environment from:

* [DevKinsta](https://kinsta.com/devkinsta/)
* [Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/wordpress/v/stable/)
* [MAMP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP)
* [XAMP](https://www.apachefriends.org)
