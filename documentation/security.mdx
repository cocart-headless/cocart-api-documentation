<Note>
    By default, CoCart cannot be found in WordPress REST API index under namespaces or routes.
</Note>

Don't be alarmed. This doesn't mean CoCart is not active on your site, we simply hide CoCart from any outsider trying to see if you are running it.

Most developers don't like the index of the REST API exposing these details so we made sure at least CoCart is not shown automatically.

<Info>
    We developed our own security plugin designed specifically for the REST API to provide a firewall from bad requests and protection for data exposed without authentication such as the index listing the routes available.

    **List of Features**
    * Hides all sensitive details from the `wp-json` index.
    * Deny access to any API route if the `user-agent` is not trust worthy or a bot.
    * Block use of any API route in an iFrame.
    * Rate limiting for any route.
    * Anonymous user data returned if accessed without authentication.
    * CORs support.
    * Permissions callback override for any route and method.

## Authentication header

If you want to change the authorization header used for authenticating users with CoCart. Use this filter to rename.

```php
add_filter( 'cocart_auth_header', function() {
    return 'Neo'; // Custom authorization header.
});
```
