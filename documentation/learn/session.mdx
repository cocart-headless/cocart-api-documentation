## Setting up Authentication

To access the Sessions API, you need to authenticate using WooCommerce REST API Keys. If you havenâ€™t already created any keys you will need to go the advanced section in your WooCommerce settings.

From there you need to press **Add key** button. Then select the user who will be using the key. Set the permissions to `READ/WRITE` so the Session API is accessible. Enter a description if you wish and then press **Generate API** key button.

You will then be presented with your `consumer key` and `consumer secret` which you will need to copy before moving away from the page as warned to the user.

Once you have your key created you can then authenticate the Sessions API.
