When using a REST-API, sometimes you don’t want all the routes to be accessible to everyone. Restricting access to certain routes can help you maintain better control over your operations.

This guide, we help enforce permissions and restrict access to specific CoCart API routes.

One clear example is that you maybe don’t want to support guest customers on your store, so you need to restrict all the public routes.

<Info>
    Forcing API permissions doesn’t mean that only administrators or shop managers can access them.
</Info>

This means that the routes cannot be used unless the API is requested while being authenticated.

<Note>
    Authentication is not forced by user role.

## How do you force API permission?

It’s actually pretty easy. All you need to do is apply a filter based on the method of the routes you want to force permission on.

There are no parameters required. Just return an array of the API routes you wish to force permission on.

Filter name: `cocart_api_permission_check_{method}`

Replace `{method}` with `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete` or `options`.

```php
add_filter( 'cocart_api_permission_check_get', function() {
  return array(
    'v1/count-items',
    'v2/cart/items/count',
    'v2/cart/totals',
    'v2/store'
  );
} );
```

That’s it.
