<Info>
    This feature is not part of the REST API. Do not treat it as such!
</Info>

<Warning>Please note: This version of the feature is for sites running versions of CoCart Core starting at v5. If you use this feature already it will break unless you follow the changes below, so check you are using the correct version before continuing with the documentation.</Warning>

This feature is designed to transfer the customers cart over to the web version of your store.

It allows both guest and registered customers to load their carts to continue shopping or checkout what they already have in the cart added via your headless application without exposing login details.

It's handy if you have not yet worked with payment gateway like _Stripe_ to handle the headless checkout.

<Note>
    Previously, if a customer is already logged in via the web version of your store then **WooCommerce** will then merge any items in the cart together with the items the guest customer has in cart.
</Note>

With load cart, registered customers do not need to provide their login details again and it makes it easier for developers to keep the customers flow without feeling disconnected.

<Note>
	FYI: If a different customer is already logged in on the same device/browser by chance, they will be logged out first to prevent the cart session losing track. Unlike in the previous version, the whole of the cart session is loaded.
</Note>

## Query properties

To load the cart from session on your web store, you must use the properties above to query your website. You can query any page you prefer your customer to land on as the cart is loaded in the background.

```https://example-store.com/checkout/?cocart-load-cart=bbfa8e97ac9cff4c861d62a109e83bb6```

<Info>
    If the same item already exists in cart and you are merging the two carts together, the quantity of that item will update if stock is available.

### FAQ

#### Can I change where to redirect customers should the cart fail to load?

```php
<?php
add_filter('cocart_load_cart_redirect_home', function() {
    return 'https://www.duckduckgo.com' // Replace redirect URL here.
} );
```

Use this filter to change the name.

```php
<?php
add_filter( 'cocart_load_cart_query_name', function() {
    return 'redpill'; // All im offering is the truth nothing more.
});
```

#### I want this feature disabled. Do not need it.

If you do not need or want to use WooCommerce native checkout then disable using this filter.

    return true;
});
```
