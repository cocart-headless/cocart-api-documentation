<Info>
    For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. Only in a local environment does the REST API simulate CORS enabled.
</Info>

If you are getting a warning about the cross origin headers then you will need to set it up.

<Note>
    If you simply want to enable but don't want to add any code snippets, you can simply [install CoCart CORS Support](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) plugin.
</Note>

## Enable CORS

```php
<?php
add_filter( 'cocart_disable_all_cors', function() { return false; });
```

For added security when you go into production. Set the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header to be more specific.

## Single Domain Access

```php
<?php
add_filter( 'cocart_allow_origin', function() { return 'https://example-store.com'; });
```
