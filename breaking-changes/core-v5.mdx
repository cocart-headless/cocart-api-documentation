## REST API

* Avatars only return if requested now when using the login endpoint.
* Store API now returns array of CoCart versions installed not just the core version.
* Product meta will not return by default. To improve security and prevent PII from exposure, meta must now be whitelisted instead using the new filter `cocart_products_allowed_meta_keys`.

## Plugin

The text domain a.k.a the plugin slug, has changed from `cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce` to `cocart-core`. This affects any translations including custom. If you did a custom translation you will need to rename the text domain to match.
